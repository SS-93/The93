# The93 Feature Marketing Plan

## 1. Executive Summary
The93 delivers a vertically integrated platform that helps artists, fans, brands, and developers collaborate around premium music experiences. The current build already ships five production-ready pillars: an artist-first content library, a cultural collaboration exchange, a live voting and scoring hub, a privacy-first onboarding flow, and an API-driven developer console. Together they form a defensible ecosystem that turns engaged listeners into co-creators and turns cultural momentum into measurable revenue.

## 2. Product Pillars & Feature Proof Points
- **Artist Content Library & Playback** – Artists can manage multi-format media, filter by status, edit metadata, and stream audio instantly within the dashboard thanks to Supabase storage integrations, role-aware filtering, and queue-aware playback hooks.【F:src/components/ContentLibraryManager.tsx†L1-L399】
- **Cultural Collaboration Portal** – A marketplace-quality workspace pairs brands and artists using rich cultural metadata (match scores, vibe guidelines, payouts, engagement rates) and supports campaign creation workflows for both sides of the marketplace.【F:src/components/CulturalCollabPortal.tsx†L1-L399】
- **Enhanced Live Voting & Scoring** – A single experience powers event chat, judge scorecards, mobile-aware layouts, participant tokens, and Supabase-backed event data so competitions can run reliably with rich feedback loops.【F:src/components/voting/EnhancedVotingInterface.tsx†L1-L400】
- **MediaID Onboarding Flow** – Multi-role onboarding captures fan/artist/brand/developer interests, enforces privacy controls, and writes MediaID profiles and logs back to Supabase for downstream personalization and compliance reporting.【F:src/components/OnboardingFlow.tsx†L1-L200】
- **Developer Dashboard & API Suite** – External partners can register apps, manage OAuth credentials, monitor API consumption, and coordinate role access in one pane of glass, signaling a mature platform strategy for third-party integrations.【F:src/components/DeveloperDashboard.tsx†L1-L200】
